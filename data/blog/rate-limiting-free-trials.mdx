> Free trials are great for onboarding—but without proper limits, they can drain your resources or invite abuse.

If you're building a SaaS product, chances are you're offering a **free trial**. But here's the catch: without **rate limiting**, you're leaving the door wide open for spam, overuse, or even full-blown abuse.

In this post, you’ll learn the **why**, **what**, and **how** of implementing rate limiting to **protect your SaaS infrastructure**—with examples in Node.js, Supabase, and Redis.

## 🧠 Why Rate Limiting Matters

Let’s say your app gives new users 100 API calls as part of a trial. What’s stopping someone from:

- Creating 100 fake accounts?
- Spamming your endpoints?
- Exploiting generous trial features with bots or scripts?

Without limits, your system becomes a **honeypot for abuse**—costing you server time, bandwidth, and sometimes, your sanity.

Rate limiting is your **first layer of defense**.

## 🛠️ Types of Rate Limiting

There’s no one-size-fits-all, but here are the common strategies:

| Type                  | What it does                                          | Best for                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Per-IP**            | Limits requests from a single IP                      | APIs, public endpoints  |
| **Per-User**          | Limits requests tied to an authenticated user         | Logged-in users         |
| **Global**            | Limits total requests per app/account per day/hour    | Fair usage across plans |
| **Burst + Sustained** | Allows short spikes, but enforces a long-term average | Real-time UIs, bots     |

For **free trials**, you should implement at least **per-user + global** limits.

## 🧪 A Simple Implementation in Node.js + Redis

Let’s build a basic rate limiter that allows **100 API calls/day per user**.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install ioredis express
```

2. Set up Redis
   Create a `lib/redis.ts`:

```typescript
import Redis from 'ioredis'
export const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL!)
```

3. Create the rate limiter middleware

```typescript
// middleware/rateLimiter.ts
import { redis } from '../lib/redis'
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express'

export const rateLimiter = (limit: number) => {
  return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const userId = req.user?.id || req.ip // fallback for anonymous users
    const key = `rate:${userId}`

    const usage = await redis.incr(key)

    if (usage === 1) {
      await redis.expire(key, 60 * 60 * 24) // 24 hours
    }

    if (usage > limit) {
      return res.status(429).json({ error: 'Rate limit exceeded' })
    }

    next()
  }
}
```

4. Apply it to your routes

```typescript
app.use('/api/free-endpoint', rateLimiter(100), handlerFunction)
```

Just like that, each user gets 100 calls/day.

## 🧰 Rate Limiting with Supabase

Supabase doesn’t offer built-in rate limiting (yet), but you can:

- Store a command_count column in your users table

- Increment it with Row Level Security (RLS)

- Use a Postgres function to block requests after the limit

- Or, set up a reverse proxy with Nginx or Cloudflare to rate-limit IPs.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always rate-limit free trial users more strictly than paid ones

- Log abuses for future banning or CAPTCHA triggers

- Combine with email verification to reduce fake signups

- Use tokens or credits instead of raw time-based access (e.g., “50 commands”)

- Display usage clearly on the UI—transparency builds trust

## 🔐 Bonus: Lock Accounts After Limit

You can also automate account locking or downgrades:

```typescript
if (user.command_count >= 100) {
  await supabase.from('users').update({ status: 'locked' }).eq('id', user.id)
}
```

Then show a message like: "You've reached your free trial limit. Upgrade to continue!"

## Final Thoughts

You don’t need an enterprise budget to enforce fair usage.

**With a few lines of code, you can:**

- Protect your app from abusers

- Keep costs predictable

- Create a better experience for genuine users

Rate limiting isn’t about being strict—it’s about being smart.
