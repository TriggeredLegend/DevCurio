## Introduction

This guide demonstrates the process of setting up an image hosting server on a Linux-based VPS and blend it with [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) for seamless image uploads.

## Prerequisites

The following requirements are recommended to ensure best performance.

#### Hardware Requirements:

| Components | Minimum              | Recommended               |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| CPU        | 1x 1.5 GHz           | 2x 2.0+ GHz               |
| RAM        | 1 GB                 | 2 GB                      |
| Storage    | 10 GB                | 10+ GB ( based on usage ) |
| Bandwidth  | 1 mbit/s (up & down) | 5 mbit/s (up & down)      |

#### Software Requirements:

| Platform         | Options                                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Operating System | Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS recommended). |
| Web server       | Apache                                         |
| Additional Tools | PHP                                            |
| Optional         | SSL/TLS for secure file uploads.               |

## Preparation

A connection has to be established via a SSH client in order to begin the setup on your Linux server. Please view our [Initial access (SSH)](linux-ssh.mdx) guide to learn more about this.

Once the connection is established, you can begin to install the necessary packages that are required for the actual setup.

## Step 1: Installing Dependencies

First, you have to install the required dependencies and web server before starting the actual setup. Use the following commands to install all the required dependencies in your Linux server.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php unzip curl -y
```

Enable required Apache modules:

```bash
sudo a2enmod rewrite ssl
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## Step 2: Create Upload Folder and Upload Script

Create the `uploads` directory:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/uploads
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/uploads
```

Open the `upload.php` script file using the nano file editor:

```
sudo nano /var/www/html/upload.php
```

Now, paste the following script into the script file:

```php
<?php
if(isset($_FILES['image'])){
    $target_dir = "uploads/";
    $target_file = $target_dir . basename($_FILES["image"]["name"]);

    if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES["image"]["tmp_name"], $target_file)){
        echo "http://YOUR_DOMAIN_OR_IP/" . $target_file; // Replace with your real IP
    } else {
        echo "File upload failed!";
    }
}
?>
```

Save the file (`Ctrl+O`, then `Enter`) and exit (`Ctrl+X`).

Set permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/uploads
```

## Step 3: Auto Expiry Script (Cron Job)

To automatically delete expired images( _It'll automatically delete images that are older than the time you specify_), create a script that regularly checks for expired files and removes them as needed ( **Only do this if you want to delete older images. If you want to keep them, skip this step** ). Create a new script file:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/expire-images.sh
```

Add the following code to the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
UPLOAD_DIR="/var/www/html/uploads"

find "$UPLOAD_DIR" -type f -name "*.meta" | while read meta; do
    expiry=$(cat "$meta")
    [ "$(date +%s)" -gt "$expiry" ] && {
        file="${meta%.meta}"
        rm -f "$file" "$meta"
        echo "Deleted expired image: $file"
    }
done
```

Save and exit the file.

Make the script executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/expire-images.sh
```

Now, set up a cron job to run this script daily. Open the crontab editor:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add the following line to run the cleanup script every day at midnight:

```bash
echo "0 3 * * * root /usr/local/bin/expire-images.sh" | sudo tee /etc/cron.d/image-cleanup
```

Save and exit the crontab editor.

## Step 4: Domain & SSL Setup

**_If you don't have a domain, you can skip this step and use your server's IP address instead._**

1. Point Domain to Server IP:
   Update DNS A record for `yourdomain.com` to your VPS IP.

2. Enable Virtual Host with SSL:
   Create Apache config file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/uploader.conf
```

Add the following configuration:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    RewriteRule ^ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName yourdomain.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem

    <Directory /var/www/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Enable the site and restart Apache:

```bash
sudo a2ensite uploader.conf
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

3. Install SSL Certificate (Letâ€™s Encrypt):

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache -y
sudo certbot --apache -d yourdomain.com
```

Follow the prompts to set up SSL.

## Step 5: Configure ShareX

1. Open ShareX:
   Go to Destinations > Custom uploader settings...
2. Create a New Uploader:

- Name: Give it a name as you wish.
- Request URL: Enter your server's upload script URL (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/upload.php`).
- Method: Set to `POST`.
- File Form Name: Set it to the input field name (`image`).
- Destination type: Tick the image uploader option.

## Step 6: Testing

Upload an image using ShareX. Verify it appears in the upload directory.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you have successfully setuped image hosting on your Linux server which has introduced searmless image hosting using ShareX!
