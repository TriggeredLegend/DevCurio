## Introduction

Accessing your Linux VPS via SSH is the first step in managing your server. SSH (Secure Shell) gives you full control over your virtual private server.

In this guide, we'll walk you through **how to SSH into your VPS using Command Prompt, PuTTY, and other alternatives**.

## What is SSH and Why Use It?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic protocol that allows you to **securely connect to your virtual private server** over the internet. Once you‚Äôre connected, you can run commands, manage files, configure software, and do everything you want.

## Prerequisites

Before connecting to your VPS, ensure you have:

- Your **VPS IP address** (e.g., `192.167.0.1`)
- Your **username** (usually `root` for most VPS)
- Your **SSH password** or **Private Key**
- A Terminal or SSH client (we'll explore a few options below)

## Method 1: Connect via Command Prompt (Windows)

If you're running Windows 10 or later versions, you can use Command Prompt (CMD) easily without installing any third-party software.

### Steps:

1. Open Command Prompt (Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter).
2. Type in the following command:

```ngnix
ssh root@your-vps-ip
```

Replace your-vps-ip with your actual IP address. Example:

```ngnix
ssh root@192.168.0.1
```

3. If it's your first time connecting to the server, type yes to continue.
4. Enter your password when prompted.

You're in! You now have full remote control of your virtual private server.

## Method 2: Use PuTTY (Beginner-Friendly SSH Client)

[PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) is a popular SSH client for Windows that provides a graphical interface for SSH connecting to your server.

### Steps:

1. Download and install [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).
2. Open PuTTY.
3. In the **Host Name** field, type:

    ```bash
    root@your-vps-ip
    ```

    Or just your VPS IP, and set **Port** to `22`.

4. If you want to use an SSH key for connecting instead of a password (which is more secure), go to:

    **Connection > SSH > Auth > Credentials**

    and browse for your private key file (`.ppk` extension).

5. Now, go back to the **Session** category in the left sidebar.
6. Click on **Open**.
7. If prompted with a security alert, click on **Yes** to trust the server.
8. Enter your username (usually `root`) and password (in case you didn‚Äôt enter any SSH key) when prompted.

You should now be connected to your server.

## Alternatives: SSH Access on Other Operating Systems

### Mac & Linux Terminal

Both macOS and Linux come with SSH pre-installed.

```bash
ssh root@your-vps-ip
```

Enter your password when prompted, and you‚Äôre in.

### Termius (Cross-Platform SSH Manager)

[Termius](https://termius.com/) is a modern SSH client available for almost all Operating Systems. It offers a user-friendly interface and advanced features like SSH key management.

## Common SSH Troubleshooting Tips

- **Connection timed out:** Make sure your VPS is running online and port 22 is open in the firewall.
- **Permission denied:** Double-check your username/password or SSH key.
- **Network issues:** Try restarting your router or connecting from a different network.

## Final Thoughts

SSH is the key to unlocking the full power of your VPS. It doesn't matter which method you use, its all about finding what works best for you.

üîí Pro Tip: Always use SSH keys instead of passwords for more secure logins.
