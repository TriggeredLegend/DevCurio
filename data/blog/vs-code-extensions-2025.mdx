# 🚀 10 Battle-Tested VS Code Extensions to Supercharge Your Development in 2025

Whether you’re a beginner learning HTML, CSS, or a backend wizard optimizing Kubernetes clusters, **Visual Studio Code** remains the go-to editor for most of the developers in 2025. But out of the box, it’s just the start.

To make VS Code more powerful and use it efficiently, you need the right extensions — tools that reduce context switching, catch bugs early, and boost your workflow.

So, here are **10 VS Code extensions** used and loved by developers across all stacks and levels — handpicked to make your code cleaner.
