To resolve the Prettier formatting errors in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Run Prettier**: Use the Prettier CLI or an integrated development environment (IDE) extension to automatically format the files. This will fix indentation and spacing issues in both `ThemeSwitch.tsx` and `AuthorLayout.tsx`.

2. **Check ESLint Configuration**: If you encounter persistent issues, consider reviewing your ESLint configuration to ensure it aligns with your Prettier settings. You may need to disable conflicting rules as suggested in the error message.

3. **Manual Review**: After running Prettier, manually review the files to ensure that the formatting meets your project's style guidelines.

No files need to be created or edited manually at this time.
